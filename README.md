# Tempo

Tempo is a simple all in one routine management application built with  [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/). 
If it's for work or general housekeeping tasks, you can track its progress, add notes, stats and even configure locations. 
Additionally, you have the possibility to schedule meetings with other team members and track the overall productivity on several projects.

**Disclaimer: this app is not ready for production use: it might potentially have some small UI bugs that need to be fixed.**

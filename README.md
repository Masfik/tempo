# Tempo

Tempo is a simple all in one routine management application built with  [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/). 
If it's for work or general housekeeping tasks, you can track its progress, add notes, stats and even configure locations. 
Additionally, you have the possibility to schedule meetings with other team members and track the overall productivity of several projects.

**âš  Disclaimer: this app is not ready for production use: it might potentially have some small UI bugs that need to be fixed.**<br><br>

Current features include:
- Authentication with Firebase
- Creating new projects
- Adding tasks to a specific project (CRUD: Create, Read, Update and Delete)
- Local storage for offline access
- Remote user data synchronisation (RESTful APIs) 
- Scanning QR codes to check-in meetings or for marking your presence
- Geolocation and Google Maps widget integration for adding your location to a specific task/meeting
